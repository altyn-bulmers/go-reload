In Go, can a single line of input be read from stdin in a simple way, which also meets the following requirements?

    can be called by disparate parts of a larger interactive application without having to create coupling between these different parts of the application (e.g. by passing a global bufio.Scanner between them)
    works whether users are running an interactive terminal or using pre-scripted input

I'd like to modify an existing large Go application which currently creates a bufio.Scanner instance every time it asks users for a line of input. Multiple instances work fine when standard input is from a terminal, but when standard input is piped from another process, calls to Scan only succeed on the first instance of bufio.Scanner. Calls from all other instances fail.

Here's some toy code that demonstrates the problem:
